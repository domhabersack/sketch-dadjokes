# Sketch Dad Jokes

This plugin for [Sketch](https://sketch.com/) adds a Data Supplier that replaces your texts with dad jokes. If you cannot use real data, dad jokes beat Lorem Ipsum by miles! This makes your designs kneeslappery fun.

The jokes are provided by [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/).

## Installation

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/domhabersack/sketch-dadjokes/releases/latest) and open the `dadjokes.sketchplugin` you find in there. Youâ€™ll only need to do this once; updates can be installed through Sketch itself.
